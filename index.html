            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
                They said,
                <q class="neighbour">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                The farmer said,
                <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
                <q class="neighbour">Oh, isn&apos;t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                The farmer again said,
                <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
                <q class="neighbour">Oh dear, that&apos;s too <strong class="bad"> bad</strong></q>
            </p>
            <p>
                and the farmer responded,
                <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
                Again all the neighbors came around and said,
                <q class="neighbour">Isn&apos;t that great!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <q>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it&apos;s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
                <strong class="good"> good </strong>or <strong class="bad"> bad</strong>
                    â€”because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</q>
